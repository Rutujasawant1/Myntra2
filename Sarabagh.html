	Saras Baug is a popular attraction in Pune which was initially a lake at the foothills of Parvati. As the water of the lake dried up, the exposed land was developed into a park and was named Saras Baug. The attraction expands over an area 25 acres and also has a temple in the centre. The shrine is dedicated to Lord Ganesh and because it was built in the middle of a lake, it is also called Talyatla Ganpati. The baug and the temple also have some historical significance as they were built during the time of the Peshwa. The temple, in particular, has been an important venue for several historical events too.

At Saras Baug, one can explore the lush green lawns which are often trimmed and well-maintained. People can also walk across the entire park through well-paved pathways. They can hang out at all the sections of the garden kept open for the public as long as they keep the surroundings clean. It, therefore, has a very relaxed sort of an ambience that draws locals in large numbers. The attraction is located at the foothills of Parvati, so, travellers can cover these two attractions in just a few hours. The park also has a small museum dedicated to Lord Ganesha. Saras Baug used to have a zoo also called the Peshwe Park which has been relocated now.
